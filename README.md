# ShopRotation-Remake
A minecraft plugin to create Chests where the server staff can create public community item goals!

##What is the ShopRotation Plugin?

"ShopRotation-Remake" is a minecraft spigot plugin to create community item goals for every member of the server.



## Installation

- Save the provided .jar file to your server's `/plugins` directory. Alternatively, you can compile the .jar file yourself by cloning and compiling this repository.
- Restart (‚ö†Ô∏è Do not `/reload`) the server to make this plugin fully functionally.
- This will create a new `/plugins/ShopRotation-Remake` folder, which will contain the SQLITE database.

## Important Notes

- This plugin does not use a `config.yml` file to modify settings, as every setting could be modified ingame due to a gui.
- Why `SQLITE` and not for example `MongoDB or MySQL`? SQLITE is a very basic and simple SQL database. Therefore it was quite easy for me personally to implement it in my project. SQLITE still provides way enough operation-speed to work as it should. This plugin does not require a highspeed and very redundant database, as it only performs a little SQL-Requests.
